# 🕹️ Hangman Game (Python)

A terminal-based Hangman game built with Python. This project focuses on core programming fundamentals such as loops, conditionals, functions, and managing game state.

This repository represents my learning progress at this stage of the course and serves as a milestone to look back on as I continue improving.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The Hangman game randomly selects a word from a predefined word list. The player attempts to guess the word one letter at a time before running out of lives.

The game includes:

* Visual lives indicator using emojis ❤️🖤
* Input validation and duplicate guess detection
* Win and loss conditions
* Replay functionality
* Modular code using multiple Python files

---

## 🎯 Features

* 🔤 Random word selection from an external word list
* ❤️ Lives system with visual feedback
* ⚠️ Warning for duplicate guesses
* 🎉 Win and 💀 loss messages
* 🔁 Replayable game loop
* 📦 Clean separation of data (words, art, logic)

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

Through this project, I practiced and learned:

* Using `while` loops for continuous gameplay
* Writing and calling functions
* Tracking game state across iterations
* Importing variables from other Python files
* Handling user input and edge cases
* Breaking down problems into smaller steps
* Debugging logic errors and understanding program flow

Most importantly, I learned how to **push through confusion** and solve problems incrementally.

## ▶️ How to Run the Game

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hangman-python.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd hangman-python
```

3. Run the game:

```bash
python hangman.py
```

Make sure you have **Python 3** installed.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

Possible enhancements I may add later:

* Difficulty levels (easy / medium / hard)
* Better input validation
* Cleaner refactoring using helper functions
* Score tracking
* Improved UI with colors or animations

---

## 🙌 Acknowledgements

* Built as part of a Python learning course
* Inspired by the classic Hangman game

## 📖 Final Thoughts

This project is not about perfection — it’s about **progress**.

Looking back at this code in the future will remind me how far I’ve come in my programming journey.

Thanks for checking it out! 😊
